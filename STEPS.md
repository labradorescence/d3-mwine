`git clone https://github.com/observablehq/react-zoomable-sunburst`

`npm i`

`npm audit fix`

`npm start`

the beatiful sunburst app shows on the browser. 

copy and paste the original mwine react folder called, `components`  and copy and paste the `App.js`

`npm i semantic-ui-react`

The beautiful D3 and my mwine react project both show on the browser.

Now, edit the `public/flare.json`
